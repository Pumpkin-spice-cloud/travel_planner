# Bettr Trip - Read Me

## Getting Started
First, fork this repo so you get your own copy of it. Once you have done that, you can clone your new repo to your machine, and get started.

You need **TWO** terminals for this.

In one terminal, run `bundle` to install the dependencies. Run `bin/rake db:setup` to create the databases (called rails_project_development by default). Run `bin/rails s` to run the server.

In the other terminal, `cd` into `client`. Run `npm install`. Then run `npm start` and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Features
